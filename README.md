### Event Finding/CRUD app

This app allows the user to login and view and store details of an upcoming event in or near Sydney.

## My plan

- create a new database and corresponding tables (events and users)
- create index page where user can choose to sign up or login.
- create sign up and login form
- create session for current user
- create a new table (user_event) where each individual user can store their own data
- user can add events to their dashboard
- they can now update or delete the desired event details
- user can use logout button to end the session

## Lessons I learned

How to add a new table to create a **ManyToMany** relationship between my records 

## Features to add in the future

- users can link up with other users in form of groups to plan for an event
- users can recieve links to headliners music
- users can get a direct link to ticketing platform
